The Electricity Bill Prediction project utilizes Machine Learning to predict a user’s monthly electricity bill based on their household appliance usage, monthly consumption, and tariff rates. The app uses a trained machine learning model to provide accurate predictions and help users optimize their electricity usage.

Features
Predicts electricity bill based on appliance usage (Fan, AC, Refrigerator, TV, etc.), monthly consumption, and tariff rates.
User-friendly interface created with Streamlit, making it easy to input data and view predictions.
Instant predictions are provided when the user inputs the number of hours appliances are used.
Machine Learning model (trained on historical data) analyzes appliance usage patterns and calculates the predicted bill.
Visually appealing design with custom background and CSS styling.
